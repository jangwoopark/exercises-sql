You decide to build a model to predict how many riders will start from each station during each hour, capturing patterns in seasonality, time of day, day of the week, etc.\n\nTo get started, create a project in GCP and connect to it by running the code cell below.

BigQuery is especially efficient with large datasets, so you'll use BigQuery-ML (called BQML) to build your model. BQML uses a \"linear regression\" model when predicting numeric outcomes, like the number of riders.\n\n## 1) Training vs testing\n\nYou'll want to test your model on data it hasn't seen before (for reasons described in the [Intro to Machine Learning Micro-Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning). What do you think is a good approach to splitting the data?

You can use the public Austin bike share dataset from the `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` table. You predict the number of rides based on the station where the trip starts and the hour when the trip started. Use the `TIMESTAMP_TRUNC` function to truncate the start time to the hour."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2) Exercise: Query the training data\n\nWrite the query to retrieve your training data.

The number of rides starting at the station during the hour. Call this `num_rides`.\nSelect only the data before 2018-01-01 (so we can save data from 2018 as testing data.)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Write your query below:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%bigquery dataframe_name","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You'll want to inspect your data to ensure it looks like what you expect.

Write a query to get the average number of riders per station for each year in the dataset and order by the year so you can see the trend.
